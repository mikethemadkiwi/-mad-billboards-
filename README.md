Example of Billboard code using Scaleform textures.    
  
A collection of mods, replicating single scaleform textures.  
These were all tested on interiors loaded and used on MY city.    
  
Visual Examples in Vanilla Unicorn + Closest Clothing Store, La Fuente Blanca (custom) & Vanilla Morgue.  
  - RequestIpl("Coroner_Int_on") -- old morgue ( built-in )

KNOWN BUGS::  
Currently trying to figure out whether having more than one load in an interior is causing multiload on all screens.  
Reloading script while live CAN cause caching issues on client.  
  
Billboards load ALL web link content.  
HIGHLY recommend using google slides on automatic transition as content.
